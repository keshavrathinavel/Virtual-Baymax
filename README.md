If you have seen the movie Big Hero 6, you have understood the advantages of a personal healthcare assistant and that their uses can be made limitless. Especially, in the case of differently abled individuals, old people etc. A personal healthcare assistant can provide immediate prognosis, tend to you, call the authorities and whatnot.

This project is similar but, a very small step towards the cause. 

The ideology of this project is to make an interactive platform that provides a medium of communication between a concerned user/patient to an AI that delivers accurate predictions for prognosis taking into consideration the symptoms and various details and applying ML approaches to devise a diagnosis. The communication/platform, the important part of this project, will be developed as a WhatsApp bot. As most Indian smartphone users have access to WhatsApp, making an easily accessible bot that one can simply text and talk to identify their symptoms and what they could immediately do to help themselves would make the process easier. Maybe if this idea catches traction in the future, we could see implementations where the bot could call EMTs in case it's a serious situation or arrange a home visit.  

Using ML approaches (Random Forest) to solve the classification problem - Whether an individual has diabetes, or not, we identify persons who are prone to the illness with an accuracy of 98.5%. 
      We do this by first, obtaining values of the data we need, from the user. These values are obtained by the means of the bot via user input. 
      Second, these values are the untrained data that we predict the labels of the data values on the basis of the trained model. 
      Third, the prediction is either 0 or 1. 1 indicating a higher probability of the person either already having diabetes or prone to it. 0 indicating that they are in the                  clear.
      Fourth, this prediction is then reported to the user via the bot.
 
The future of a system like this can cut costs, reduce the carbon footprint, deliver more accurate responses etc. The advantages are limitless through innovation.
