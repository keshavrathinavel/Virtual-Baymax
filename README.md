Our idea is to make an interactive platform that provides a medium of communication between a concerned user/patient to an AI that delivers accurate predictions for prognosis taking into consideration the symptoms and various details and applying ML approaches to devise a diagnosis. The communication/platform, the important part of this project, will be developed as a WhatsApp bot. As most Indian smartphone users have access to WhatsApp, making an easily accessible bot that one can simply text and talk to identify their symptoms and what they could immediately do to help themselves would make the process easier. Maybe if this idea catches traction in the future, we could see implementations where the bot could call EMTs in case it's a serious situation or arrange a home visit.
